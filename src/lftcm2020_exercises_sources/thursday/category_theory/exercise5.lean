We prove that biproducts (direct sums) are preserved by any preadditive functor.

This result is not in mathlib, so full marks for the exercise are only achievable if you
contribute to a pull request! :-)

In fact, no one has gotten around to defining preadditive functors,
so I'll help you out by doing that first.

-- Challenge problem:
-- In fact one could prove a better result,
-- not requiring chosen biproducts in D,
-- just asserting that `F.obj (X ⊞ Y)` is a biproduct of `F.obj X` and `F.obj Y`.
